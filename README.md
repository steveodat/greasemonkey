# greasemonkey
Some greasemonkey scripts I use to make some sites less annoying (facebook, twitter, etc.)

<h3>Facebook</h3>

Hides all the garbage.  Hides the trending topics box as well, but adds in a toggle if you just can't help yourself.

<h3>Twitter</h3>

Hides Moments, other nonsense.  Adds a toggle for getting rid of followed-folks-favs showing up. (That bit was mostly just to see if I could do it)

<h3>Youtube</h3>

Makes the header static instead of fixed, because when I've got youtube open in a perfectly sized window, I don't need the logo and search bar visible.  Waste O'Space. And when I've got that perfectly sized window open while I'm working, I don't want to scroll down to re-align the next video that plays, so I added a bit that does that for me as well.  Laziness enabling through up-front effort: The steveodat way.
